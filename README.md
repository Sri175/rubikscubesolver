Rubik's Cube Solver Project
Overview
This project is a Rubik's Cube simulator and solver designed to provide various functionalities, including:

Simulating and performing all 18 Rubik's Cube moves.
Printing the cube in a planar representation format.
Checking if the cube is solved.
Random shuffling of the cube with a solvable configuration.
Solving the cube using advanced algorithms, potentially using Pattern Databases for optimization.
Features
Cube Simulation: Perform rotations like F, U, R, etc., and track cube state.
Planar Representation: Display the cube in a 2D layout for easy visualization.
Random Shuffle: Generate a randomly shuffled cube that is solvable.
Pattern Databases (optional): Leverage precomputed pattern databases to improve solving speed and reduce the search space.
Solving Algorithm: Utilize algorithms like IDA* and Korfâ€™s Algorithm to find the optimal solution.
